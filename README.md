# FPLdatasets
This repository contains training and testing datasets based on underlying metrics of FPL players, used for the machine learning models in my dissertation project

The training datasets for each position are located in the training folder.

The test datasets are split into GW4, GW5 and GW6 folders within the test folder.

Note that not all statistics in these files are used in the final models.
